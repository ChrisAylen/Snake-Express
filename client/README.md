## Description
    
This is a MERN stack application that allows the user to play Snake!  Additionally, it uses GraphQL for data management.

The game keeps track of user scores using both local storage (just for local user scores) and Mongo DB for all user scores allowing the application to keep track of the all time top 10 scores.
